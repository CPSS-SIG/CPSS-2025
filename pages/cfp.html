	  <h1>Call for Papers: The 5th Workshop on <b>C</b>omputational Linguistics <br/> <br/>for the <b>P</b>olitical and  <b>S</b>ocial <b>S</b>ciences (CPSS-2025)</h1>
<p>
  CPSS-2025 will be the 5th annual meeting endorsed by the GSCL Special Interest Group Computational Linguistics for the Political and Social Sciences (CPSS). The workshop will take place in September 2025 at <a href="https://konvens-2025.hs-hannover.de/">KONVENS</a> in Hildesheim, Germany.</p>
<p>
	CPSS-2025 will provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of innovative
 	research on all aspects of using CL/NLP techniques for the political and social
 	sciences, including:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>Modeling political communication with NLP (e.g. topic classification, position measurement)</li>
	 <li>Mining policy debates from heterogeneous textual sources</li>
	 <li>Modeling complex social constructs (e.g. populism, polarization, identity) with NLP methods</li>
	 <li>Political and social bias in language models</li>
	 <li>Methodological insights in interdisciplinary collaboration: workflows, challenges, best practices</li>
	 <li>NLP support to understand and support democratic decision making</li>
	 <li>Resources and tools for Political/Social Science research</li>
	 <li>and many more...</li>
</ul>
	<br/>
	<p>
CPSS-2025 will be held in person.
</p>
<br/>


<h2>Special Theme</h2>
<p>
The special theme of CPSS-2025 is <br/><b>Validation and best practices for using NLP in political and social science research</b>.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to CPSS's general topics, we specifically invite submissions on this
	year's special theme, focussing on validation and best practices for applying NLP
	techniques for research in the political and social sciences. We are especially
	interested in papers addressing issues related to:
	<ul>
		<li>Data quality in human and synthetic data</li>
		<li>Data leakage and contamination, especially in LLMs</li>
		<li>New ways to collect data such as dataset donation</li>
		<li>Validation of results beyond the train-dev-test paradigm of NLP and data science.</li>
		<li>Any other topics related to the special theme.</li>
	</ul>

	<br/>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<p>
All submission deadlines are 11:59 p.m. UTC-12:00 “anywhere on Earth.”<br>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p> Submission website coming soon...
<!--The submission site is now open at <a href="https://softconf.com/acl2025/law2025">https://softconf.com/acl2025/law2025</a>.-->
<br><br>
</p>
<p>	We solicit two types of submissions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>archival papers</b>  describing original and unpublished work (long papers: max. 8 pages, references/appendix excluded; short papers: max 4 pages, references/appendix excluded). Accepted papers will be published on the ACL anthology. For the submission format, refer to the KONVENS guidelines.</li>
	<li><b>non-archival papers</b> (1-page abstracts, references excluded) describing ongoing work, PhD projects, or already published research.</li>
	</ul>	

	<br/>	
<h2>Submission format</h2>
	
<p>Long/short archival paper submissions must use the official <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">ACL style templates</a>. Non-archival papers (abstracts) can use any style template and must be submitted as pdf. Long papers must not exceed nine (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. Non-archival abstracts must not exceed one (1) page. References do not count against these limits.
</p>

<p>Please note: The appendix does not count against the page limit but should not include essential details needed to understand/review the paper (appendices can contain details such as hyperparameters, formulas, proofs, and tables that are informative but not critical to the understanding of the paper). All submissions must be in PDF format.
</p>	

<p><b>Template for abstract submissions: </b><br/>

	Non-archival abstracts should be formatted according to <a href="CPSS-2025-abstract-template.zip">this</a> template.
</p>
<p>   
Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest to the workshop. We also invite substantiated position papers, in particular with regard to our special theme. Accepted archival papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.
<br><br>
A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.
<br><br>  
Reviewing of archival papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authors’ identity--e.g., "We previously showed (Chen et al., 2024) ..." should be replaced with citations such as "Chen et al. (2024) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
<br><br>
Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (<a href="mailto:ines@informatik.uni-mannheim.de">contact email</a>). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.
<br><br>
<!--Following the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy">ACL and ARR policies</a>, there is no anonymity period requirement.-->
<!--We follow previous and current <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Author_Guidelines">ACL policy</a> to establish an anonymity period (from submission to author notification) during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed. Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.-->
<br><br>
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the <a href="mailto:ines@informatik.uni-mannheim.de">program co-chairs</a>.
